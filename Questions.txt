****************NOTES******************
Datasets -> Why we selected them.

Local pace -> Proof that that option is a good/the best option from other work

Simple object generation -> Check if you mention twice about the idea of simple objects

Complexity: refers to the structural complexity of the image. This includes attributes like dimensionality, number of lines and number of objects in the image.
Diversity: is defined in terms of a specific subset of images, in particular, it refers to the variety of objects contained in that subset of images. The diversity of a subset of images can be measured by analysing the information entropy for the set i.e., the measure of randomness of the data in the set \cite{wang2022survey}.
Noise: refers to the amount of random variation of colour in an image that does not relate to the object that has to be identified in the image. An image where the background consists of only one colour is thus considered to be less noisy than an image with a multi-coloured background.

************************QUESTIONS****************************
Early stopping did not work great to actually stop the training (It works, but it is not optimised.)
    - Evidence suggests that less epochs can be used, but we did not test this.
    - Future work

Bad training accuracy, but good test accuracy, Good training accuracy, but bad test accuracy
    - Bad dataset split?
    - Overfitting? 

Why is the performance on AlexNet better than ResNet?
    - Gets convoluted?
    - Overfits?
    - Not enough information to learn?

**List software -> Have a public github

-> Keep having the Libraries

-> Aim for Saturday

Should I still have a section for programming languages and Libraries
    - How in depth into the convoluted
    - Theoretically oversighted topics as applied.

***************************HINTS****************************
When talking about hyper parameter tuning: 
    - We selected Adequate parameters

Graphs to draw + Stats to compute:
    - Convergence plots that include the std (plot line with deviation)
        - Baseline vs Proposed
    - Line graphs for convergence
    - Tables for final best performance
    - Box and whisker -> for outliers?
    - Graphs that give additional insights 

    - Hypothesis testing -> Will coxin rank sum test
        null -> Samples from same distro
        what we want-> Smaples from different distro
        -> Calculate p values

    - Add some discussion points about how it was ordered.
        - After 5 epochs 

Networks to use:
    - ResNet and AlexNet
    - The goal is to show the performance due to
