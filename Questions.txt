Early stopping did not work great
    -> Should I do some experiments to show that the training can be less for certain datasets?
    -> Should 70/80 epochs be less for the simple objects?
    -> What is the effect of this?

It works, but it is not optimised.

Early stopping

Bad training accuracy, but good test accuracy
